# ReverbTimeCalculator
"Reverb Time Calculator" This project is a reverb time (T60) calculator that allows you to estimate the time it takes for sound to decay in a specific room. It uses data about the room's surface materials and their dimensions to provide an accurate T60 estimate. A useful tool for sound designers, acoustic engineers, and music enthusiasts!"
